					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>
						Hello. I'm Göktuğ from Ankara, Turkey. Currently, I'm working on a website as full-stack
						freelance developer while studying at Bilkent University at the same time.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've been coding since when I was around 12 years old, started with Arduino and then continued
						with web development and finally at my current job, working as a full-stack developer. I know
						JavaScript, TypeScript, React and few other things related to development with JavaScript(such
						as NodeJS etc.). As I have mentioned before, I also worked on robotics a while ago and I used
						C++ while building my robots with Arduino. I'm actually very interested in Machine
						Learning/Artificial Intelligence topics and I generally try to advance myself in such areas
						whenever I get a chance. I'm looking forward to step up my game on robotics with connecting AI
						with my Robots probably using Raspberry Pi. I also have some interests on cloud related things
						(as you can see from my Google Cloud Study Jam t-shirt and mug on my picture, hehe) so I try to
						do some fun projects with them in order to have more experience with them.
					</p>
					<p>
						I actually love taking photos at night, don't have a DSLR camera yet but thinking about buying
						one when I get a chance, and of course, I love playing games as well :)
					</p>
					<p>Oh, also one thing to note, I LOVE INTERSTELLAR.</p>
					<p>
